Schrodinger's Wave Equation
===========================

Schrodinger's Wave Equation is a second-order linear differential equation that is useful for describing 
the motion of electrons through a crystal structure. Here's what we know:

* The wave equation parallels the well-known equivalence of total energy to the sum of kinetic and potential energy (TE = KE + PE).
* This also holds true for a given field described by the wave function &psi;(x,t). Therefore, TE&psi; = KE&psi; + PE&psi;.
